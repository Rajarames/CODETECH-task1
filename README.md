OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:-BLINK A LED AT SPECIFIC INTERVAL
Blinking an LED
Blinking an LED is an introductory Arduino project in which we control an LED using Arduino. LED blinking refers to the process of continuously turning an LED (Light Emitting Diode) and off in a repetitive pattern. It is a simple and common demonstration in electronics and microcontroller-based projects.

Working Procedure
setup() and loop() are two fundamental Arduino functions for controlling the behavior of your board. The Arduino framework automatically calls these functions, which form the foundation of any Arduino program.

The setup() function is only called once when the Arduino board boots up or is reset. Its goal is to set pin modes, initialize variables, and execute any other necessary setup tasks before the main loop begins. This function can be used to configure settings that should only be changed once over the board’s lifespan.

The loop() function is the heart of an Arduino program. After the setup() function is executed, the loop() function starts running repeatedly until the Arduino is powered off or reset. It contains the main code that performs the desired tasks, controls the board, user input. Whatever is included in the loop() function will be executed in a continuous loop, allowing the Arduino to perform its intended functions continuously.

In the code, we have declared two integers, LEDpin and delayT. LEDpin represents the pin number of the Arduino where LEDs need to be connected, and delayT is an integer variable for the delay() function. The delay() function accepts values in milliseconds.
CONCLUSION:-
The Arduino LED blinking project provides a hands-on introduction to microcontrollers, hardware interfaces, and programming ideas. It serves as a foundation for more sophisticated projects and allows you to experiment with numerous Arduino features and capabilities. Whether you’re new to electronics or an expert maker, this project will help you develop crucial skills and knowledge for future Arduino-based projects.
